Hello and welcome to the code behind the study "Gravitational wave inference on a numerical-relativity simulation of a black hole merger beyond general relativity"

Performing a similar analysis takes a number of steps:

1. Generate your own beyond-GR waveforms
2. Perform a morphology-independent Bayeswave analysis 
3. Perform a template-based Bilby analysis
4. Jointly post-process the analysis data
